# Linux Course Description - 2025

Linux/Unix is the primary platform for computational science. The goal of this course is to train scientists in its use with particular emphasis on the needs of bioinformatics users. The course covers basic Linux commands and utilities, running and managing computational jobs, and handling and manipulating large biological datasets.

By the end of the course, students will:

- Be comfortable with the Linux command line and command-line programs, including the ability to move, create, or edit files and directories
- Know how to search, manipulate, and process large datasets
- Write and execute small bash script programs
- Know how to connect to a remote server like the (Alpine)[https://www.colorado.edu/rc/alpine] system and run jobs on it. You can find more information and documentation about Alpine [here](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clusters/alpine/index.html).

# Time and Place

**Come to class:** The lectures will be very interactive with individualized help only available in the classroom, so in-person attendance is encouraged. <ins>Class starts on August 25th and ends on September 21st. 

**Lectures:** Tuesdays and Thursdays, 10:00 - 11:50 am in AZ building, room E210

**Class Recordings:** Lectures will be recorded on Zoom, and then posted to canvas. Students can choose to attend class sessions over zoom instead of in person as needed. Due to a lengthy zoom-to-canvas conversion, videos will not be available until late afternoon or the following day. Please note - coming to class is the best way to learn!

# Attendance

Class attendance is not mandatory, but please let me know if you will be attending multiple classes remotely or making them up at a later time. I just want to make sure I know who is still engaged.

# Office Hours

Because this course is so flexible, it puts a lot of responsibility on you to ensure you are keeping up with the class content. My office hours for this class will be <TBD>. Please come, and don't feel like you need to have dedicated questions. You can show up to do your homework, or chip away at your final projects, or solicit any advice. This is a casual affair.

# Prerequisites

Students do not need to have any prior experience in computing, programming, or coding.

Graduate standing is encouraged but not required. An interest in using LINUX/UNIX in your research work is encouraged. We will focus on using LINUX/UNIX to support research primarily in the life sciences. However, the content is broadly applicable to many fields.

**BEFORE** the first day of class, ensure you have purchased, uploaded, or installed all the required hardware and software. See [COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS](COMPUTER REQUIREMENTS).

# Textbook

[The Linux Command Line, 5th ed](https://github.com/jesshill/CSU-2025FA-DSCI-510-001_LINUX_as_a_computational_platform/blob/main/The-Linux-Command-Line-Book-5th-Edition.pdf) by William Shotts. The book is available as a **free, downloadable pdf** from the book website (also attached here) or as a paperback widely sold by booksellers.

# Communications

We will be using **Canvas Discussions** for class-wide communications.

# Instructors

Jessica Hill, PhD	

jesshill@colostate.edu or canvas e-mail

**NOTE:** I ask for your patience throughout the class as there will be bumps in the road, that is just the way it goes. 

Please e-mail me with any questions through regular e-mail or canvas e-mail. Course content-related questions that are e-mailed to instructors may be posted (anonymously) on Canvas Discussions for a faster response and to broadcast insight to the group. Personal or individual concerns will not be disclosed in that way.

# Grading

Your grade for this course will be based on assignments, participation, and a final exam. The percentages are as follows:

- Assignments: 70%
- Participation: 10%
- Final exam: 20%

The calculation of the final letter grade will be made as follows:

- A: 90 - 100%
- B: 80 - 89.9%
- C: 70 - 79.9%
- D: 60 - 69.9%
- F: below 60%

# Assignments

- Assignments make up 70% of your course grade.
- There will be 6 assignments.
- If you need to turn in an assignment LATE, please talk to me and request additional time before the due date. You may turn in an assignment up to **48 hours late** but only with **PRIOR** approval!

# Student Disability Accommodations

SDC accommodations: I recognize that the Student Disability Center is behind in issuing accommodation letters. If you have a situation that requires SDC accommodations, please e-mail me directly and we can make arrangements. You can do this even before your official paperwork is processed in the SDC. This class has a lot of flexibility for all students with or without letters.

# Privacy/Posting Policy

The instructor **does not** permit the distribution of course material. This means you are not permitted to post course content, course videos, or representations of the class online. We are offering recordings for students to assist them in learning. Please be respectful of people's privacy with these recordings and content.

# Expectations

You are expected to be familiar with the [Student Code of Conduct](). This course will adhere to the [CSU Academic Integrity Policy](). At a minimum, violations will result in a grading penalty in this course, a report to the Office of Conflict Resolution and Student Conduct Services, and communication with your professor and/or graduate program director.

Colorado State University has clear [Principles of Community](). We each have the responsibility to uphold these values as we interact with one another and learn.

Please know that use of Chegg, Course Hero, or other web services that market themselves as tutoring or study guides are not permitted in this course. Many instances of their use are a violation of the Student Integrity Policy. To learn more [Chegg and Course Hero Misconduct]()

# ChatGPT Statement

*Things may change in future classes. Other professors will have different statements.*

I implore everyone to think deeply about their own **personal goals** for this class. What do you want to master? What do you want to take with you after you leave?

Chances are, you want to gain a **skillset** to apply to your research and career.

The best practices for learning new skills are to **practice, struggle, experiment, spend time, think deeply, and sit with the material.**

ChatGPT has advantages and disadvantages in this learning process.

**Beneficial usage and suggestions:**

- Conversational: A prompt like “Teach me how to use a for loop in bash scripting” can organize information succinctly without ads.
  - Tip: I suggest using Gemini where you can run a “double check responses” (G button) on the bottom and follow the references
  - Warning: information is not always accurate
- Grammar & Light editing: Using ChatGPT to decode tricky English turns-of-phase or assist with grammar
  - Tip: I suggest Grammarly. Even its free version is more honed at this task and integrated into other programs. Paid version is impressive.

**I strongly discourage the following usage:**

- Generative - Using ChatGPT on the homework negatively impacts learning.
- Generative - Using ChatGPT to write your code is risky (can be wrong) and negatively impacts learning.

Unsure about what is ok and not ok?

You can always e-mail me to ask. Also, if you would like to disclose your usage of ChatGPT in any assignment or in the Exam Project, I encourage you to do so. You can include a statement like…

- I did not use Generative AI for this assignment.
- Generative AI helped with grammar and readability, but the original writing was my own.
- Generative AI helped with idea generation, but I wrote the assignment myself.
- A small amount of my work (just a couple of sentences) was written by Generative AI.
- Generative AI significantly wrote my work, but I edited it.

Also - please contact me if you are feeling overwhelmed or getting behind in the class. I'd rather give you the opportunity to learn the content than put you in a situation where you feel you need to speed through without learning using ChatGPT.

# Health and Safety

Don't feel pressured to come to class if you are ill. Staying home when you are sick prevents the spread of disease. If this happens, you can use the simulcast and recorded options. You can e-mail the TA, professor, or join in for study sessions if you have questions
