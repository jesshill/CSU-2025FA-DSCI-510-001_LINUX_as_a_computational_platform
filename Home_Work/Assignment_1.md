## Question 1

Test the two commands below. Make sure to navigate away from your home directory to several different locations to test them in order to understand their full behavior. Explain what each command does.

```
$ cd ~
```
```
$ cd -
```

## Question 2

The grandparent directory: Can you find TWO ways to move into the grandparent directory in a single command? That is, how can you move from
`/Users/erin/Documents/Photos/Selfies/` to `/Users/erin/Documents/` by executing `cd` just once? Find TWO ways to do this. One way should use an **absolute path** and the other should use a **relative path**.

## Question 3

If I have several directories within my `Photos` directory, like so: 
`/Users/erin/Documents/Photos/Instagram/`
`/Users/erin/Documents/Photos/NikonPics/`
`/Users/erin/Documents/Photos/PanoShots/`
`/Users/erin/Documents/Photos/Selfies/`

How would I move from within the `Selfies` folder to the `Instagram` folder using one `cd` command that uses a **relative path**?
