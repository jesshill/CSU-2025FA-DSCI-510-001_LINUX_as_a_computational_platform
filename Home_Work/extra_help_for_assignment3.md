### This file was too big to host on github, so I had to put it on Canvas!

- This file is available for download on Canvas, under modules "additional data for Assignment 3 (as needed)"

- Download by clicking, and saving to an appropriate directory.
- Unzip the tarball.
- This contains the contents that would have been downloaded using the `rsync` or `wget` command in the exercise instructions.
