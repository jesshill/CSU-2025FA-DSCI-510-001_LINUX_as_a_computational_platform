### Do I have nano?

See if it's installed: 

```
$ which nano

/usr/bin/nano
```

Or just try to run it:

```
$ nano
```

If it's there, you will see your screen change to the editor, otherwise, you will see

```
-bash: nano: command not found
```

### Introduction to the interface

If you just type `nano` and hit return, you open the interface.

```
$ nano
