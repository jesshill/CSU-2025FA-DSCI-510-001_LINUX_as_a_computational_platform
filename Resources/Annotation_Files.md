# GTF/GFF Files

**GTF (Gene Transfer Files)** or **GFF (General Feature Files)** store annotation information about a particular sequence.

- Features can be: genes, exons, introns, primer binding sites, origins of replications, anything you can think of.
- GTF/GFF files are made of tab-separated columns. Each row is a “feature”.
- GTF/GFF files can be paired with a FASTA file to give a user the complete information about a sequence and all its features.
- GTF files can be uploaded to visual viewers of genomes and the features can be graphically displayed.
- File extensions can be .gff, gff2, gff3, or gtf. These share much of the same formatting with the exception of the the way the group information is formatted.
- The tab-separated columns of information are:

| # | Feature | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | seqname | The name of the sequence. Must be a chromosome or scaffold |
| 2 | source | The program that generated this feature |
| 3 | feature | The name of this type of feature. Some examples of standard feature types are “CDS”, “start codon”, “stop codon”, and “exon”. |
| 4 | start | The starting position of the feature in the sequence. The first base is numbered 1. |
| 5 | end | The ending position of the feature (inclusive). |
| 6 | score | A score between 0 and 1000. If the track line useScore attribute is set to 1 for this annotation data set, the score value will determine the level of gray in which this feature is displayed (higher numbers = darker gray). If there is no score value, enter “:.”:. |
| 7 | strand | Valid entries include “+”, “-”, or “.” (for don't know/don't care). |
| 8 | frame | If the feature is a coding exon, frame should be a number between 0-2 that represents the reading frame of the first base. If the feature is not a coding exon, the value should be “.”. |
| 9 | group | All lines with the same group are linked together into a single item. |
