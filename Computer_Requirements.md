# Computer Requirements

By using Linux on your own computer you can more quickly incorporate what you learn into your own research. Before coming to the first class, please ensure you have done Steps 1, 2, and 3 below. We will work on Step 4 in class …

1. Select a computer to use in the class
2. Learn how to open the Linux terminal on your computer
3. Download a text editor
4. Request an Alpine user account

## 1. Select a computer to use in the class

You will need to have either a MAC laptop, a laptop running Windows 11, or a Linux laptop. CSU will no longer be supporting PC laptops running Windows versions less than 11 on their internet. If you don't have a MAC, Windows11, or Linux laptop, please obtain one! There are laptops available for rental through the [Morgan Library](https://lib.colostate.edu/services/borrow-renew/borrowing-laptops/). Check that same link for laptop rentals available through each college. Your graduate program, department, or lab may have laptops to borrow.

If your laptop is very slow or near dying, please consider borrowing a laptop for the class.

The computer should be a laptop. A tablet or iPad is not going to cut it!

## 2. Learn how to open the terminal on your computer

What is a terminal? It should look something like this:


Here are the options for accessing a terminal on different systems. Again, please verify you can access your terminal before class:

### Mac OS users 

Lucky you! Your Mac runs on a Linux-like operating system. All you need to get running is to familiarize yourself with the **Terminal** application.

1. Go to **Finder**
2. Go to **Applications**
3. Go to **Utilities**
4. Click on **Terminal** to open the application
5. For faster access, you can drag and drop **Terminal** into your Dock.

To bump your Mac into power user mode, you'll need **Xcode**. To obtain Xcode …

- Go to App Store
- Search for Xcode
- Download and install Xcode. This will take a while to download and install. It may be a good idea to do this overnight.

### Windows OS users

Your PC needs to be running 64-bit Windows 10 with the Windows 10 Fall Creator Update (October 2017). To check your version check updates here. If your computer is up to date, you can install Linux on top of the Windows operating system. Please read Install the Linux Subsystem on Windows 10 to install the system. Opt for UBUNTU distribution (not LTS) if/when you have a choice.

When complete, you'll be asked for a username and password specific to your Ubuntu installation. These don't need to be the same as your Windows 10 credentials. With this step complete, you'll find yourself at the Ubuntu bash command line.

:!: Tips for installation

Don't forget your username and password for ubuntu! Write it down. You'll need it for the class!!!
Having trouble getting the `Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux` line to execute? Make sure you are in a PowerShell with Administrator privileges (aka, an elevated powershell). To open one, search PowerShell in the windowsStart search bar, then RIGHT click on powershell, then select “Run as Administrator”
