# More Pipes

Now that we know what piping is, we can discover some new functionalities of Linux. Let's learn how to pipe the following commands:

`sort` - sort lines in a file
`uniq` - find unique (or duplicated) lines in a pre-sorted file
`tee` - redirect stdout or stderr to multiple locations

**!!! Exercise:** Let's download a small file [mini.gff](https://github.com/jesshill/CSU-2025FA-DSCI-510-001_LINUX_as_a_computational_platform/blob/main/Data/mini.gff).

- To download, right-click and open in a new tab
- click on the down arrow to download
- save to an appropriate place
- sync your working directory (in the terminal) with the directory containing mini.gff
