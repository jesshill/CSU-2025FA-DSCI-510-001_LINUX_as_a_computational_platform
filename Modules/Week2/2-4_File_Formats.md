# File Formats

Let's learn about file formats. Different file formats are typically identified by specific file extensions, suffixes to their names that inform programs of their type. Two general types of file formats are:

- text files (also called flat files) are files that have only text information.
- binary files files that have more complex information that can be interpreted as formatting, images, application-specific objects, as well as text. Examples: .docx, .xlsx, .jpg, .pdf, and .m4p

How do you we know something is a text file?

- It has the file extension like .txt, .csv, .fa, .gb
- You can use `more` or `less` to read through it
- You can use a **text editor** to view and edit it

How do we know something is a **binary file**?

It has a specific file extension associated with a specific program
It was produced in a specific program (Microsoft Word, for example)
If you use `more` or `less`, it looks like a bunch of alien writing

**!!! Quick Tip:*** 

- If you cannot see file extensions on your computer, take a moment to make these visible.
- It is good practice to always save files with the proper file extensions! All files should have extensions!!
- Some standardized file formats will have lines at the beginning that start with #. These are comments. They typically contain information about how the information was generated.
