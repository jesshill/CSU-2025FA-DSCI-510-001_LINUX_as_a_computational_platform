# File Formats

Let's learn about **file formats**. Different file formats are typically identified by specific **file extensions**, suffixes to their names that inform programs of their type. Two general types of file formats are:

- **text files** (also called **flat** files) are files that have only text information.
- **binary files** files that have more complex information that can be interpreted as formatting, images, application-specific objects, as well as text. Examples: .docx, .xlsx, .jpg, .pdf, and .m4p

How do you we know something is a text file?

- It has the file extension like .txt, .csv, .fa, .gb
- You can use `more` or `less` to read through it
- You can use a **text editor** to view and edit it

How do we know something is a **binary file**?

It has a specific file extension associated with a specific program
It was produced in a specific program (Microsoft Word, for example)
If you use `more` or `less`, it looks like a bunch of alien writing

**!!! Quick Tip:*** 

- If you cannot see file extensions on your computer, take a moment to make these visible.
- Where do file extensions come from? For flat, text files, you put them there!
- It is good practice to **always save files with the proper file extensions!** All files should have extensions!
- Some standardized file formats will have lines at the beginning that start with `#`. These are comments. They typically contain information about how the information was generated.

#### Text Editor 

Everyone will need to install a [text editor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_editor) for writing and modifying plain text files.

- Mac:
  - Recommend [BBEdit](https://www.barebones.com/products/) or [Xcode](https://xcodereleases.com/). Click Download under the BBEdit software. You dont need to buy it. The free version does everthing you need.

**!!! Warning:** Do not use MAC's application called **TextEdit**. It is a rich text format editor and not a flat text editor.

- Windows 11:
  - Recommend [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), BBEdit, or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) do not recommend TextEdit, Wordpad, Notebook, EMACS, or Microsoft Word.
  - If you already have a text editor you like that is not listed, you are free to use it provided it saves files in true flat .txt and not rich text format.
