### Making Directories

We can make a new directory using the command `mkdir` (MaKe DIRectory):

`mkdir <newdirectoryname> …`

**!!! Quick tip:** The … means that you can add either one or more newdirectorynames.

**!!! Exercise:** Let's make a new directory called “mynewdir”

```
$ mkdir mynewdir
$ ls
```

### Removing Directories

We can remove empty directories using `rmdir` (ReMove DIRectory):

`rmdir <directoryname> …`

**!!! Exercise:** Let's remove the “mynewdir” directory

```
$ ls
$ rmdir mynewdir
$ ls
```

**!!! More Exercises:** 

1. Through the terminal, navigate to the place in your computer where you want to store files for this class. If you haven't already made a directory specifically for this class, use `mkdir` to make that directory.
2. Navigate inside your new course directory.
3. Make some subdirectories for the course like “Assignments”, “Notes”, “Exercises”.
4. Check out your subdirectories using `ls`
5. Hmm, maybe those subdirectories don't sort the way you want them to. Delete the directories “Assignments”, “Notes', and “Exercises”.
6. You can add multiple directories by listing new directory names after `mkdir` separated by spaces: `mkdir dir1 dir2 dir3`
7. Using one `mkdir` command, make the directories “01_Notes”, “02_Exercises”, “03_Assignments”.
8. Now `ls` to see the subdirectories. 

### Making Files

Files are documents that live within directories. All files in the Linux environment should follow some naming standards …

- NO spaces
- NO weird characters (A-Z, 0-9, _, - are OK)
- Should contain a file extension (.txt, .docx, .png, etc)
- Should not be the name of a function (like ls)

**!!! Quick tip:** If you cannot see file extensions on your computer, take a moment to make these visible:
  - [MacOS show file extensions](https://www.idownloadblog.com/2023/05/23/how-to-show-hide-filename-extensions-mac/)
  - [Windows show file extensions](https://www.howtogeek.com/205086/beginner-how-to-make-windows-show-file-extensions/)

There are many ways to make a new file. We'll cover just a few: 

#### Making files with `touch`

We can make a new file with **touch**:

`touch <filename.txt>`

**!!! Exercise:** Let's navigate into your directory **01_Notes** and make the file `quick_tips.txt`.

```
$ touch quick_tips.txt
$ ls
$ ls -alh
$ more quick_tips.txt #peek into the file quick_tips.txt
```
#### Writing file content with `nano`

Well, that's a pretty boring file. Let's add some content to it using the linux text editor called **nano**. This command will be different than previous commands we've executed. Instead of spitting something out to the screen below the prompt, nano will take us to a little text editor app within the terminal where we can type in some text. To exit out of nano, type CTRL+X. To save, type `y`.

`nano <filename.txt>`

It'll look like this:

<p align="center">
<img width="410" alt="nano" src="https://github.com/jesshill/CSU-2025FA-DSCI-510-001_LINUX_as_a_computational_platform/blob/main/Images/nano.png">
</p>

**!!! Exercise:** Let's add content to `quick_tips.txt` using nano:

```
$ nano quick_tips.txt
```

- Type in some content.
- Remember, to exit out of nano, CTRL+X. Then press `y` to confirm.
- Check the content using `more quick_tips.txt`.

#### Making files with `nano`

We can also make new files by skipping touch and just starting up nano directly.

**!!! Exercise:** Let's make the new file `common_pitfalls.txt`.

```
$ nano common_pitfalls.txt
```

We will learn other ways to create new files in future lessons, too.

**!!! Bonus Content:** For more detailed information on Nano: [nano tutorial](../../Resources/nano_tutorial.md)

### Removing Files

We can remove files using `rm` (ReMove).

`rm [-i] <filename.txt>`

`-i` is an **option** for running `rm` interactively. It requests a confirmation to remove. Please get in the habit of using this option.

**!!! Common pitfall:** **THERE IS NO UNDO IN LINUX**. Yep, that's right. If you remove a file, it's gone. There's no trash can or recycle bin you can pull that file out of. It is gone-gone!

**Do not combine `rm` and `*` together. It is possible to delete everything.**

**!!! Quick tip:** Always make sure you have a good backup system in place. A good back up system is automatic.

Let's say we don't want the file `common_pitfalls.txt` anymore.

```
$ ls
$ rm -i common_pitfalls.txt
$ ls
```

**!!! More Exercises:** 

1. Navigate to the course directory. If you execute the `ls` command, you should see the directories "01_Notes", "02_Exercises", "03_Assignments".
2. Navigate into "02_Exercises".
3. Create a new file with today's date somewhere in the filename and a .txt file extension.
4. Copy and paste the instructions for this exercise into the new text file.
5. Use `more` to peek into your new text file.
6. Use `rm -i` to delete your newly made text file.

### Removing directories and their contents with `rm`

We can also remove directories AND all their contents using `rm`:

`rm [-ir] <directoryname>`

- `-i` interactive. request confirmation to remove.
- `-r` recursive. remove entire directory and contents.
- `<directoryname>` the name of the directory you want to remove.

Always specify `-i` because there is the potential for deleting more than you bargained for.

**!!! Common pitfall:** Until you are at Linux ninja status, please use `-i` with all your `rm` commands. Please use caution when using `rm`. Also, please have a good backup strategy in place as well.

### `rm` with training wheels

**!!! Cool Trick:** Better yet, we can write a new command called `srm` for Safe ReMove, like so:

```
alias srm='rm -i'
```

- Note, this only works if the spaces/no spaces are strictly adhered to.
- Now you can remove files using `$ srm file.txt` and you will automatically be prompted whether you are sure.
- This behavior will reset when you close the terminal. We will show you later in the course how to permanently customize your user experience so this behavior is permanent.

**!!! Exercise:** 

- Use the alias code to set up `srm`.
- Make a file called `testingfile1.txt` (use nano or touch).
- remove `testingfile1.txt` using `srm`.
