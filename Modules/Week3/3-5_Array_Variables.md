### Array Variables

So far, we have assigned only a single value to each variable. We can also assign multiple, ordered values to a variable. These create **array variables**.

Arrays are zero-based. That is, the first element is accessed with the number 0.

**Assign values** to an array variable using parentheses:

```
arrayname=(value1 value2 value3 value4)
```

**Dereference** the list in a variety of different ways:

```
echo $arrayname
echo ${arrayname[*]}
echo ${arrayname[@]}
```

**!!! Recall:** We just used parentheses to capture the output of a command into a variable, but in those cases, there was an extra dollar sign in the syntax: 

```
$ myscripts=$(ls *.sh) #captures the names of scripts in a directory as the values of an array variable
 
$ echo $myscripts
 
$ myships=(enterprise discovery titan voyager) #assigns values to an array variable
 
$ echo $myships
```

Let's explore this more. Make a bash script called `exploringArrays.sh`. Within it, create the array `ships` with four **values**. Values are also called **elements**. We can access the elements in a variety of ways:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
# Create an array variable
ships=(enterprise discovery titan voyager)
 
# Explore the elements
echo ${ships[*]} # all elements
echo ${ships[@]} # all elements
echo ${ships[0]} # the first element
echo ${ships[1]} # the second element
echo ${ships[2]} # the third element
echo ${ships[3]} # the fourth element
```

In the example above, the number within the square brackets is called an **index** (plural is indices or indexes). The process of accessing an individual element using an index is called **indexing**. Indexing relies on the fact that elements within an array have a set order.

We can also use indices to add a new element to an array or to **reassign** an element of an array. Try this:

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
# Create an array variable
ships=(enterprise discovery titan voyager)
 
# Explore the elements
echo ${ships[*]} # all elements
echo ${ships[@]} # all elements
echo ${ships[0]} # the first element
echo ${ships[1]} # the second element
echo ${ships[2]} # the third element
echo ${ships[3]} # the fourth element
 
# Add a new starship
ships[4]="excelsior"
 
echo "Added a new element: ${ships[*]}"
 
# Replace a starship
ships[1]="defiant"
 
echo "Changed an element: ${ships[*]}"
```

Finally, we can assess how many elements are in an array variable using the following syntax:

```
# length of an array variable. That is, how many elements are in the array:
echo ${#ships[*]}
```

**!!! Independent Exercise:** What cities have you lived in and in what order?

- create an array variable called `mycities`
- Add the names of cities you have lived in as individual elements
- **Hint** use quotes to enclose values that contain spaces like “San Francisco”
- Write a little paragraph using an echo statement about your life in which you dereference the different cities using indexes.
- Your final output should read something like the below paragraph:

`“I was born in Palo Alto. I grew up in Saratoga. I moved to Santa Cruz for college. Then I lived in Eugene. Next, I moved to Berkeley for graduate school. After that, I lived in Chapel Hill. Now, I live in Fort Collins.”`

**!!! Alternative Exercise:** If you haven't lived in very many cities, that's ok. You can list cities you have visited or cities where you wish to live or visit.
