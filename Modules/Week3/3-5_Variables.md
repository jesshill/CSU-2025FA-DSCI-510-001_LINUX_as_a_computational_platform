# Variables 

**Variables** are placeholders for information. The information can either stay constant throughout the script or change.

All programming languages use variables so if you are learning this concept here for the first time, welcome! You will see this concept again and again as you learn new languages.

Basically, a variable is just a **name** that is given to a **value**. Variables are **assigned** values using the syntax:

```
varname="value"
```

Then, the value can be accessed by typing the variable name after a dollar sign like this - `$varname` or with a fancier syntax like this - `${varname}`. This is called **dereferencing** a variable. For example, we can print out a variable's value using `echo` like so:

```
echo $varname
echo ${varname}
```
