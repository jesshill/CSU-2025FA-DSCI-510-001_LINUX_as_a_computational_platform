# String Operations

In computer programming, a **string** is a sequence of characters. Variables often point to values that are strings. Sometimes we want to do operations on those strings. We can do this using **string operations**.

By far the most common string operations I perform are **replacements** which just means substitution. Another common operation is **sub-setting** or selecting out just a portion of the string, also called a **sub-string**.

**Replace a part of the string**

`<newvarname>=${<oldvarname>/<pattern>/<replacement>}`

Make a new variable `$newvar` that replaces one instance of “pattern” in `$oldvar` with “replacement”.
