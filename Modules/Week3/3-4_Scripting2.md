# A little more detail about bash terminology

What is **shell scripting**? We are doing shell scripting because this scripts will be read and executed by the shell. When we use the bash shell it's called **bash scripting**. bash is typically the default shell program on most all LINUX operating systems and installations. Didn't know we had more than one shell? It's true. Most LINUX or mac operating systems come with a few different versions of the shell under the hood. In fact, MAC has now switched to the zsh shell which is an extended version of bash with some improvements.
