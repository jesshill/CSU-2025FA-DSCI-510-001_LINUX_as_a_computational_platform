# Working with files 3 - `sed`, `tr`, `AWK` substitutions 

Already, we have learned many ways of working within files to read, find, or change their contents.

- cat
- grep
- cut
- sort

In this section we'll learn

sed
tr
AWK (I'll just reference you to AWK)
In this section, we'll add to our toolkit by learning three ways to find and replace select content within a file. The first is using sed â€“ Stream EDitor. sed is a complex program capable of filtering and transforming text within a file. sed is capable of very complex functionality, but for today, we'll just learn its find and replace function.

The second way to substitute content will be using tr or the translate command. This is a more simple, limited utility.

And the last is awk which I'll just describe and refer you to, but we won't delve into.
