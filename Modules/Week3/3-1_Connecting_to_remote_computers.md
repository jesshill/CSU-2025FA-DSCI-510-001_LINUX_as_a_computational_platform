### Connecting to remote computers

Up to this point, we have only used the terminal to interact with your **local** computer. Today we will talk about several ways we can use the terminal to interact with **remote** computers over the internet.

In some instances, we will **log into** a remote computer, also known as **connecting** to it. This will allow us to interact with that computer as if we had opened its terminal. With this access, we could navigate that computer's file structure, write new files, run jobs, or transfer files. It would be just like interacting with our local computer.

This differs slightly from **transferring files** between the remote computer and our local computer. We transferred files from UCSC Genome Browser to our local computer. In that instance, UCSC Genome browser set up a special **public-facing, read-only** directory of files that we could copy over to our computer but we wouldn't be able to write files there or run commands there.

What types of remote computers can we log into?

```
1. remote personal computers
2. servers or repositories (computing or file storage)
3. supercomputers
```

### Accessing remote computers with ssh - Secure SHell

**ssh usage**

```
ssh <addressOfRemoteServer>

ssh [-l <yourloginname>] <addressOfRemoteServer> #that's a lower case “L”
```

**!!! Exercise:** Try logging into Alpine using **ssh** 

The login address for ALPINE is: `login.rc.colorado.edu`

If your username is `loki@colostate.edu`, and your password is `godofmischief`, you would log in like so:

```
$ssh -l loki@colostate.edu login.rc.colorado.edu
Password: godofmischief,push
# Switch to your DUO app on your phone to approve
```

**!!! that's a lower case "L"**

**!!! Replace your eID e-mail with loki@colostate.edu**

**!!! You won't see anything pop up when you type your password**

**!!! If `,push` doesnt work, try `,phone` or the 6-digit code on your DUO app (refreshes every 20 seconds)**

**!!! Exercise:** Make a file.
- Use nano to create a file called `iwashere.txt`
- Write a little note

### Accessing ALPINE using OnDemand

The team at CU Boulder who developed ALPINE have helped to create an alternative way to interact with the ALPINE Supercomputer, one that can happen in you internet browser like Chrome or Firefox. This method of accessing ALPINE is called OnDemand.

**!!! Exercise:** Let's practice accessing ALPINE using OnDemand together.

- Navigate to [OnDemand](https://ondemand-rmacc.rc.colorado.edu/pun/sys/dashboard) in a new tab or window
  - For me, I right click on the above link and select **Open Link in New Window**
  - You will be asked to select an identity provider using a pull-down menu. Select on the pull-down menu (it may say **ORCID**). Start typing **Colorado State University**. Click on **Remember** and log in. It should look like this



Next steps:
- Log into your CSU NET ID. You will receive a DUO PUSH on your phone. Accept it.
- To access the LINUX command line on ALPINE, go to the **Clusters** menu. Select **>_Alpine Shell**
- In another window, you can also access your files by going to the **Files** menu and selecting any available directories.

**!!! Reflection:** How did this go for everyone? What problems were encountered?
