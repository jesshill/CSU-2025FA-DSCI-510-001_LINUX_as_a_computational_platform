# Environmental Variables 

### The Environment

Every shell session operates in the context of a larger **environment** or the general, system-wide context in which the shell is operating. For example, the user's name, the default terminal display, and the default language will all be aspects of the environment. Information about the environment is stored in the shell as **environmental variables**. We can examine the environment using the command `printenv`

```
$ printenv
```

For me, this spits out the following â€¦

```
TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
SHELL=/bin/bash
TERM=xterm-256color
HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY=/opt/homebrew
TMPDIR=/var/folders/5y/0vkm85c12s935r1qs0ls7_y80000gn/T/

```

The contents of `printenv` are different for everyone - that's the point. These are individualized parameters that tell us about your specific computer and your specific user experience.

**!!! QUESTION:** How many different settings (environmental variables) do you have?

```
$ printenv | wc -l
22
```

Environmental variables are different from special variables and user-defined variables because they are generated by the shell itself, every time a session is started.
