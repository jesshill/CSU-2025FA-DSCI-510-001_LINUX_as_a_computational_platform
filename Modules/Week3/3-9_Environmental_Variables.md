# Environmental Variables 

### The Environment

Every shell session operates in the context of a larger **environment** or the general, system-wide context in which the shell is operating. For example, the user's name, the default terminal display, and the default language will all be aspects of the environment. Information about the environment is stored in the shell as **environmental variables**. We can examine the environment using the command `printenv`

```
$ printenv
```

For me, this spits out the following â€¦

```
TERM_PROGRAM=Apple_Terminal
SHELL=/bin/bash
TERM=xterm-256color
HOMEBREW_REPOSITORY=/opt/homebrew
TMPDIR=/var/folders/5y/0vkm85c12s935r1qs0ls7_y80000gn/T/

```

The contents of `printenv` are different for everyone - that's the point. These are individualized parameters that tell us about your specific computer and your specific user experience.

**!!! QUESTION:** How many different settings (environmental variables) do you have?

```
$ printenv | wc -l
22
```

Environmental variables are different from special variables and user-defined variables because they are generated by the shell itself, every time a session is started.

### Some interesting environmental variables

Here are some interesting environmental variables outlined in [the optional course textbook](https://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php)

Most environmental variables are all caps, but not all of them. This is why it is bad form to make your own, personal variables in all caps.

We can **dereference** environmental variables like any other variable.

**!!! EXERCISE:** Follow along

```
$ echo $USER
$ echo $SHELL
$ echo $HOME
$ echo $PWD
$ echo $OLDPWD
$ echo $PATH
```

### How is the environment established?

Every time we start a shell session, the shell acquires information about the environment by reading **configuration files**. Some of these are system-wide files that you don't modify. But a few of these, such as **startup files** are modifiable by the user and can allow you to create a customized user experience.

Typically, startup files are located in your $HOME directory and are named:

```
# Where ~ is the symbol for your $HOME directory:
~/.profile
~/.bash_profile
~/.bashrc
~/.zrc
~/.zenv
```

These will differ depending on your operating system and version of the shell.

Later, we will learn to modify these configuration files to customize our user experience. For now, just know that they exist, they are used to customize the user experience, but one should tread with caution before altering them. These files impact how your terminal, shell, and computer operate.
