# Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux

- An operating system
- A language
- A philosophy
- A prominent example of the open source movement

### Where did Linux come from

- UNIX was developed by AT&T's Bell Laboratories in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and their team.
- An unpatented system
- The name is a joke/pun. There was an operating system at the time called MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). Thompson and Ritchie named their operating system UNICS (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) as a play on MULTICS and because it sounds like “eunuchs”.
- UNIX became the basis for other operating systems (OS) in use today like MAC OS, Linux, Android.
- Linux, based on UNIX was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki. It is a fusion of the original UNIX operating system and many added-on features, most from a project called GNU. Is sometimes referred to as GNU/Linux.
- Currently, linux is not one operating system, but a family of systems that come in many flavors, also called distributions or distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, CentOS, etc).
