# Navigating the file system

### Who, What, When, Where commands

In your previous exercise you did the following:

```
$ whoami
$ hostname
$ pwd
$ ls
$ date
$ cal
```

Hopefully, when you typed in these commands, the shell responded more intelligibly than when you typed gibberish. This is because commands are programs that the shell has installed. When you type the command, you are instructing the shell to run a program it recognizes.

```
$ whoami  #WHO am I?
$ hostname  #WHAT computer is this?
$ pwd  #(Path to Working Directory) WHERE on the computer am I?
$ ls  #(List Segments) WHAT are the contents of this directory?
$ date  #WHEN? What is the date and time?
$ cal #WHEN? cute little calendar of this month
```
