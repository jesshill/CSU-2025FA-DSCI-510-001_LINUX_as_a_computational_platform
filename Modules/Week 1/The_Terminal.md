# The Terminal

Today, most of the applications or programs we run on our computers are Graphical User Interface (GUI, pronounced “gooey”) applications. These are typically a window that pops up with a work space, menus, and icons. We can visually see things, “move” them, and click on things. Even the “Finder” (MAC) or “Explorer” (Windows) are GUI applications.

This wasn't always the case. When computers were first developed, all user interactions occurred by typing on the keyboard into a text interface.

Linux maintains this older, text-based interface through the terminal emulator, or **terminal**. By typing into the terminal, we can interact with the **shell**. The shell is a program that will take our text input and pass it to the **kernel**. The kernel is the core operating system that will assess how best to carry out each job given the computer's hardware and the task at hand.
