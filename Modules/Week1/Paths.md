# Paths

### Moving around: absolute paths v. relative paths

The types of paths we've used for navigating up to this point are called relative paths. This means that they only make sense from the perspective of the current working directory. In contrast, we can use cd to take us to absolute paths that would make sense anywhere on the computer system. Absolute paths always begin with the root directory, /. When we execute pwd, the shell spits out our current working directory as an absolute path because it start with a / such as /Users/erinnishimura/.
