# Working With Files 1

### Peeking inside files with more and less

There are four main commands for printing file contents to the screen …

- **more** – scroll down through files
- **less** – scroll up or down through files
- **head** – show the top n lines. The default is n = 10
- **tail** – show the bottom n lines. The default is n = 10

**!!! Exercise**: 

- Navigate to your directory titled `chromsizes2`
- Try the following ways of peeking into files in that directory …

```
$ more ce11_chrom_sizes.txt # OR
$ more hs1_chrom_sizes.txt
```

Use **spacebar** or **down arrow** or **return** to scroll down

Type **q** to quit

```
$ less hs1_chrom_sizes.txt
```

Use spacebar or down arrow or return to scroll down
Use b or up arrow to scroll up
