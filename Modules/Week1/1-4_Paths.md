### Moving around: absolute paths v. relative paths

The types of paths we've used for navigating up to this point are called **relative paths**. This means that they only make sense from the perspective of the current working directory. In contrast, we can use `cd` to take us to **absolute paths** that would make sense anywhere on the computer system. **Absolute paths** always begin with the root directory, `/`. When we execute `pwd`, the shell spits out our current working directory as an absolute path because it start with a `/` such as `/Users/jessicahill/`.

**!!! Vocabulary**: 
- **Absolute path:** The exact, full address of a file or directory starting from the root `/`. The absolute path always starts with a forward slash. An example of navigating using an absolute path would be `cd /home/martha/dogstuff`
- **Relative path:** The location of a file or directory that only makes sense in the context of a given working directory. Examples of navigating using a relative path would be `cd subdirectory` or `cd ..`

**!!! Example**: Changing directory using an **absolute path:**

```
$ cd /home/users/erin/documents
```
**!!! Example**: Changing directory using an **relative path:**
```
$ ls 
dropbox  documents  pictures  music
$ cd music
```

**!!! Exercise**: Open your Finder/Explorer and navigate to some directory on your computer where you keep a piece of data you've recently gathered. Look at the path bar to get a sense of where this directory is located. Now, using the terminal, try to change into this directory using an absolute path as the argument for a cd command. Use **TAB** to autocomplete to save time and improve accuracy.

**!!! Quick tip**: When moving up or down a directory structure using relative paths, you don't need to jump down each directory one at a time. You can double up your jumps using a `/` between directories. For example, if you are in `/Users/Name/` and you want to be in `/Users/Name/Documents/Labwork/`, try:

```
$ pwd
/Users/Name
$ cd Documents
$ cd Labwork
```

OR

```
$ pwd
/Users/Name
$ cd Documents/Labwork
$ pwd
/Users/Name/Documents/Labwork/
```

**!!! Quick tip**: We have used `ls` to list the contents of our current working directory. If no argument is specified `ls` defaults to listing the contents of the current working directory. We can also specify the name of the directory whose contents we want to list as an argument … even if we are not in that directory! We can use either an absolute or relative path for this …

```
$ ls 
Homework Labwork Servicework
$ ls Servicework
application1.docx report1.docx report2.docx
$ ls /home/users/sandra/sheetmusic
eight_polonaises.pdf hungarian_dance_no5.pdf six_variations.pdf 
```

### Shortcuts

**TAB** - autocomplete

**CTRL+u** - erase the current line

**CTRL+l** - (that's a lower case “L”), clear the terminal screen

**CTRL+a** - go to the beginning of the line

**CTRL+e** - to go the end of the line

**CTRL+c** - cancel out of a program or command that is being executed

**CTRL+d** - log out of the terminal

**UP arrow** - print out the last command executed (even if it failed).
