# Welcome to class!

### Introduction: 
- Jessica Hill, PhD - Instructor

### Introduction to the class: 
- Please read through the [Syllabus](../../Syllabus.md) to learn more about the class.
- This class is the first in a 3-part series. The other 2 classess are Python (Dr. Tai Montgomery) & RNA-seq data analysis (me again). The RNA-seq class focuses on building pipelines using Linux and R.
- Requirements: [Computer_Requirements](../../Computer_Requirements.md)

# Introduction to Linux

### What is Linux

- An operating system
- A language
- A philosophy
- A prominent example of the open source movement

### Where did Linux come from

- UNIX was developed by AT&T's Bell Laboratories in 1969 by Ken Thompson and Dennis Ritchie and their team.
- An unpatented system
- The name is a joke/pun. There was an operating system at the time called MULTICS (Multiplexed Information and Computing Service). Thompson and Ritchie named their operating system UNICS (Uniplexed Information and Computing Service) as a play on MULTICS and because it sounds like “eunuchs”.
- UNIX became the basis for other operating systems (OS) in use today like MAC OS, Linux, Android.
- Linux, based on UNIX was first released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds at the University of Helsinki. It is a fusion of the original UNIX operating system and many added-on features, most from a project called GNU. Is sometimes referred to as GNU/Linux.
- Currently, linux is not one operating system, but a family of systems that come in many flavors, also called distributions or distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, RedHat, CentOS, etc).

- The Linux Distros in this picture are those off the Fedora, Gentoo, Debian, and Arch Linux Branches.
- MacOS, Android, and those off the BSD, XNU, or Mach kernels are considered separate operating systems due to their considerable evolution away from the Unix design.

### Why should we use Linux?

- Power
- Efficiency
- Automation
- Reproducibility
- Fun
- **Free**

### Partner Exercise #1

- Turn to a partner
- Introduce yourself to your partner
- Discuss: What do you hope to gain from this class and by learning Linux?
- Discuss: Are there data types or analyses you want to use Linux to address?
- Share: Please write down some notes about what you and your partner discussed here (names are optional)
- **Asynchronous & Remote Students** - Please join in, too! Add your ideas to the document!
