# Wildcards

So far, we have always typed out the exact argument names. We do this by hand-typing or using `tab` to auto-complete the name of a file or directory. This performs operations on **specific** files or directories. We can also use **wildcards** to ask the shell to perform operations on groups of filenames or directories. Wildcards are special characters that will match a set of characters. This can extend the command by performing the action on more than one file at a time.

`*` this can represent any number of characters (including zero, in other words, zero or more characters)

`?` this can represent any single character

- Please Refer to Chapter 4 in the textbook, The Linux Command Line, for a detailed discussion on wildcards. Today, we will just cover two types of wildcards, `*` and `?`.
