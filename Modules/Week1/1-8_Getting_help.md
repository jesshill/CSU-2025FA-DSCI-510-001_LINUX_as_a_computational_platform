# Getting Help ???

### Getting help on the internet 

**!!! Quick tip**: If you need help!, your first line of defense is GOOGLE!!! Some common sites that have large repositories of computational questions and answers:

- stackoverflow.com
- stackexchange.com

**!!! Quick tip**: If you don't immediately find what you're looking for on a google search, try adding the following terms to your search:

- “linux”
- “can't … linux”
- “howto … linux”
- “howto … linux mac”
- “howto … linux windows 11”
- **command name + error message**

**!!! Quick tip**: Ask your professors and classmates for help by posting on Canvas Discussions!

**!!! Common pitfall**: Don't post your question to a popular public messageboard (stackoverflow, stackexchange, etc) unless you know the proper protocol for how to ask questions.

### Getting help within Linux

*Depending on how the command was written, you can access its help page in a few different ways. You'll need to try each.*

**man** <command>
**help** <command>
**command** -h
**command** --help

**!!! Quick tip**: When navigating the **man** pages press `spacebar` to scroll down and `q` to exit.

**!!! Quick tip**: Man, or **manual**, pages will seem like they are written in a cryptic foreign language. Just look for the relevant information. With use, they become less cryptic.

If you get stuck in a weird place try these options …

```
q

CTRL + C

CTRL + D

<return> <return>

# or if you get stuck somewhere try..

$quit
$exit
$logout
$bye
```
