# Final Exam

- **Due by Teusday September 23 rd at 11:59 pm.**
- If you need more time to complete this exam, please contact me in advance!
- This exam accounts for 20% of your final grade. 

### About the exam

This exam will be a **project**. You will be asked to pick a **standardized file type** in your field. You will be asked to **write a bash program** that performs some operation on this standardized file type. Your program should be able to take one or more of these standardized file types and perform some operation on them. It will also report a **message** if the user did not execute the program properly.

Students who have gotten the most out of this exercise have found ways of linking this exercise to their immediate research goals and projects. If you are not in a lab with a project, you can still work to link this project to your life in some way. Text/flat files are all around us. I am totally ok with this exercise having nothing to do with your project or even science. Be creative!

### Grading 

The grade for the final will be structured like so …

```
1  pts - Question 1
1  pts - Question 2
2  pts - Question 3
10 pts - Question 4
   3 pts - Does the script perform the operation? What are the known bugs or issues?
   2 pts - Does the script output a message that describes its proper usage if input is not supplied?
   2 pts - Does the script contain loops and/or conditionals (3 total)?
   2 pts - Your script should report to the user what is happening in each step
   1 pts - Your script should be commented
3  pts - Question 5
3  pts - Question 6

20 pts - TOTAL
```

## Question 1

Select a standardized file type in your field. You can use any flat/text file formats listed in this [Wikipedia page of scientific standardized file types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_file_formats). OR, you can pick any other file type that is flat. If you are a master's student or a graduate student not currently in a lab, you can pick any of the file formats we covered in class (.fa, .gtf) or go on the internet and try to learn more about how information is stored in the field or profession you eventually wish to join.

**Answer the following:** What **file type** did you select? Write a brief paragraph that describes the information that is gathered in your file type, what it is used for, and how it relates to a larger field of study.

Please break down how the information is organized within your file. For example, if your file has columns, what is tabulated in each column? For full credit, this answer must contain a list of each column number and its header, and/or a description of the file's sections of information.

## Question 2

**Answer the following:**
- A. What is the operation your script will perform?
- B. Why is this a useful operation to do in your field or in your project?
- C. Outline a few key commands or steps your script will do. 

Having trouble? Think about how you might filter, sort, select, re-format, compile, quantitate, or display information from your text file in a way that would be meaningful.

## Question 3

**Answer the following:**
- A. What is the **input** for your script? Describe the input and attach an example input file.
- B. What is the **output**? Describe the output and attach an example output file.
- C. What is the **command line** that would be executed to generate your example output file from your example input file using your script. Write out the command line in full.

To grade this question I will test your script using the command line you write in C, the script you supply, and the supplied input in A. You will receive full credit if my output matches your example output in B. For this reason, please tell me about any options or typed content that I will need to generate the output. You must include the input file, the script file, the output file, and a written description of how to execute the script for full credit.

If your input files are giant, please include a “tester” file. It will be a smaller version of the giant file that can still be used on the code. Please include the output of that tester file. Contact me if you have questions.

If I can't run your code and compare it to your output, you won't get points associated with this question.

## Question 4

Write your script and attach it. Your script will do an operation on one or more of the same file types. Your script should output information from its operation 1) to the screen, 2) into a re-directed file, or 3) into an output file.

Attach your script as an `.sh` file. If your script works on the input in Question 3A to produce the output in Question 3C, you get full points. If it half works or works in some situations, you will get partial credit. For example, if your script works on your example input file(s) supplied in Question 3A, but not on a general, different file, that is partial credit.

Known bugs & issues. If your code doesn't work or has bugs, please describe here the issue you're having.

If the user fails to provide an input file, your script should print to the screen that something is wrong and suggest the proper usage of the script using a **usage statement**.

Example:

```
$ bash gtf2bed.sh 
$ GTF2BED>>> ERROR >>>
  Please provide a proper input file in the form: 
     bash gtf2bed.sh input.gtf
```

Your script must contain **at least 3 loops or conditionals** in any combination (3 loops, 2 loops + 1 conditional, etc).

Your script should report to the user (display) what it is doing at different steps in the process.

Your script must take in an input file using a special variable like $1.

Your script should be properly commented.

Bonus goals - Can you have your script generate a final report to the user?

Bonus goals - can you think of how to write in an “option” using an if statement?

## Question 5 - Automation Question

*Note: This question is unrelated to the above project.*

**Answer the following:**

Carol has written a short bash script that takes in a file as a single argument and copies a backup into a backup directory with a new name (see below). Currently, this script only operates on one file at a time and is executed using the code `bash saveBackup.sh file1.txt`. How could she use a loop to automate this backup script so that it can work on many text files and be called using `bash saveBackup.sh *.txt`? *Use the hints in the code to help guide you.*

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
# Make a backup directory if it doesn't already exist
mkdir -p backups
 
# Acquire the input filename. ## Hint - change this line to acquire multiple files
inputfile=$1
 
## Hint - Start loop here
 
# Substring replacement to create an output file name
outputfile=${inputfile/.txt/_bkp.txt}
 
# Save the backup 
echo -e "\nBacking up $inputfile. Saviing it as $outputfile in backup directory\n"
 
cp $inputfile backups/$outputfile
 
## Hint - Stop loop here
 
echo -e "saveBackups.sh program complete\n"
```

## Question 6 - command line LINUX

*Note: This question is unrelated to the above project.*

Write a single line of code that will analyze a .gtf file and spit out the unique types of feature entries and how often they appear in the .gtf file.

For example, given the file SARSCov2_ncbiGenes.gtf, this would output the following:

```
$ <yourlineofcodehere> #using SARSCov2_ncbiGenes.gtf as input
  13 CDS
  13 exon
  12 start_codon
  12 stop_codon
  12 transcript
```

**Please answer the following:**
- A. What is the line of code that will give you the output listed above?
- B. When you use the same line of code on the human .gtf annotation file [hg38.ncbiRefSeq.gtf.gz](https://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/bigZips/genes/), what is the result?
