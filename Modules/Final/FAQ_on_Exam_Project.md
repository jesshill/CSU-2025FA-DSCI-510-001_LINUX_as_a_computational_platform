# Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) on Final Exam Project

**!!!**  **I don't know what to do for my project.** Are you having trouble figuring out a file type or project? Click here for [examples of previous projects](Examples_of_previous_projects.md).

**!!!**  **I still don't know what to do for my project.** Talk to others in the class, talk to your PI or other lab members for ideas, or come talk to me.

**!!!**  **I thought my project would be hard, but it turns out it's easy. Is my script too short?** This happens frequently. This is ok. Think of ways you can “pad” your script into a larger program. Could your script do a little retrospective analysis after it completes and report to the user what happened? Could you try to execute the code in a slightly different way and prompt the user on which behavior they choose? Could you loop your code so it could execute automatically on many different files supplied to it? Or multiple directories of files?

**!!!**  **Warning Fasta files:** If you are planning to work with fast files, just a warning that these projects can be tricky. Please check in with me about your plan. We can do the project, but I want to make sure you know what you're getting into and that I have sufficient time to help support you. We have also included some code on how to convert fasta to strings here: [Tips & Tricks](Tips_and_Tricks.md)

**!!!**  **HELP! Nothing's working! I'm stuck. I don't know what to do!!!! AHHAHHAAHAH!!!!** If this happens to you, just e-mail me or come to office hours. Try to start working on this project early so you have plenty of time to resolve any strange bugs.

**!!!**  **My code doesn't work!** It's ok. Your code doesn't have to work for you to get most of the points on this exercise. If your code doesn't work, just explain the problem and you will get partial credit.
