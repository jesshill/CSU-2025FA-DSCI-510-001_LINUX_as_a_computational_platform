# Conditionals 

Conditionals are if/else statements that allow us to skip over blocks of code entirely based on passing or failing of a test. The simplest conditionals just involve the command if.

### `if`

If statements allow us to modify our code to only execute commands only IF a particular test is true. If a particular test is true, a set of actions are performed. If it is not true then don't perform those actions.

if usage
if [ <some test> ]
then
