### Reminder: 

Final exam due on teusday September 23rd! 

### Test your understanding - take this quiz!

[Quiz 7]()

### Exercises for practice

**!!! Exercise 1** - Use a `for` loop structure to produce the following output:

```
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
blast off!
```

**!!! Exercise 2** - Use a `while` loop structure to produce the same output above.

**!!! BONUS - Exercise 3** - `measureDiskSpace.sh` - Add to the `measureDiskSpace.sh` script so that instead of printing content to the screen, it now redirects all its output to a file called `diskUsage_output.txt`

**!!! BONUS - Exercise 4** - `measureDiskSpace2.sh` - create a conditional inside your loop that gives a different message if the file is empty like so …

```
$ bash measureDiskSpace.sh *.txt
The file listOfHouses.txt takes up 4.0K of disk space
The file text1.txt takes up 4.0K of disk space
The file text2.txt takes up 4.0K of disk space
WARNING! text3.txt is empty!!!
The file text4.txt takes up 4.0K of disk space
```

Answer for Exercise 4:

  <summary>Answer</summary>

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
#Note: This answer contains a conditional within a for loop...
 
# For loop
   # If
   # Else
 
 
# Capture arguments
myarguments=$@
 
#Loop over each argument
 
for myfile in ${myarguments[@]}
do
	# Calculate the disk usage for a file
	# Remove the file name from the output using cut
	# Remove white space from the output using sed
	myspace=$( du -h $myfile | cut -f 1 | sed 's/ //g' )
 
	# Check if $myspace is 0B
	if [ $myspace == "0B" ]
	then
		# If file is empty, say so
		echo "File is empty!"
	else
		# If file is not empty, print the sentence including the file name and the disk usage:
		echo -e "The file $myfile takes up $myspace of disk space"
	fi
 
done
```

**!!! SUPER ULTIMATE NINJA SKILLS CHALLENGE EXERCISE - Exercise 5** - Remember the SARS-COV2 GTF file we downloaded before? Go ahead and download that again. Write a script that selects only the coding sequence entry lines (says CDS on column 3), and then outputs the gene name (written after gene_id in column 9), and then calculates the length of the coding sequence, and then outputs the following:
- Input file: [SARS-CoV-2 genome](https://github.com/jesshill/CSU-2025FA-DSCI-510-001_LINUX_as_a_computational_platform/blob/main/Data/SARSCoV2_ncbiGenes.gtf)
- Example output: 
```
ORF1a 	13214
ORF1ab 	13202
ORF1ab 	8084
S 	3818
ORF3a 	824
E 	224
M 	665
ORF6 	182
ORF7a 	362
ORF7b 	128
ORF8 	362
N 	1256
ORF10 	113
```
- Note: - this is super hard and you'll need to try things that we didn't cover in class as well as navigate through some weird syntax funkiness.

Answer for exercise 5:

  <summary>Answer</summary>

```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
 
# take in the file as an argument/special variable
mygtf="$1"
 
# Select just the CDS entries
grep 'CDS' $mygtf > temp.gtf
 
# Acquire gene names, start, and stop as array variables
genenames=($(cut -f 9 temp.gtf | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sed 's/"//g' | sed 's/;//g'))
starts=($(cut -f 4 temp.gtf ))
stops=($(cut -f 5 temp.gtf ))
 
# Initiate a counter
x=0
 
# Conditional While loop
while [ $x -lt ${#genenames[@]} ]
do
 
	# print the gene name
	echo -ne ${genenames[$x]} "\t"
 
	# calculate the length of the 
	diff=$((${starts[$x]} - ${stops[$x]}))
 
	# conditional - if it's a negative, take the positive
	if [ "$diff" -lt 0 ]
		then
        diff=$(($diff * -1))
	fi
 
	# print out the distance 
	echo $diff
 
	# increment the counter
	((x++)) 
 
done
```

**!!! Conditional Practice Challenge - Exercise 6** Recall how we can pass an argument into our script as input like so …

```
$ bash countingLines.sh file1.txt
```
