# Next steps on ALPINE!

This is about all the time we have for this class. I encourage you to learn more about how to use ALPINE on your own and through future workshops and classes.

Here are what I would consider the next steps:
- Learn to customize your user experience by editing your `.bash_profile` on ALPINE.
- Learn to load already-installed software using **modules**
  - [About modules on ALPINE](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/compute/modules.html)
- Learn to install software on ALPINE using CONDA
  - [Getting started with CONDA](https://curc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/software/python.html#basic-conda-commands-to-get-you-started)
  - [Upcoming workshop on conda and software install on ALPINE](https://www.colorado.edu/rc/events)
- Learn how to save, synchronize, and version-control your scripts using github
- Learn how to organize large computational projects - DSCI512 - RNA sequencing data analysis
